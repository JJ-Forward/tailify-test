# Tailify Test

Campaign report and Kitty page for Tailify interview test.

## Getting Started

The campaign (index.html) and kittie page (kittie-test.html) are both built using the AngularJS framework. The campaign page also utilises UI router.

### Prerequisites

To get the pages running locally download all files and folders and run on a local test server (UI router will not work without) for more information and CDN options for AngularJS and UI router details are below.


```
ANGULARJS: The AngularJS framework can be downloaded from https://angularjs.org/ however we recommend using Google's CDN https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.4/angular.min.js
```

```
UI ROUTER: UI router can be downloaded from https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router the CDN can be accessed via https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular-ui-router/0.2.15/angular-ui-router.js
```
